                                            NUMA’s acceleration program is dedicated to early stage startups at the seed or early-growth stage. The program is focused on Mobile Technologies, but this means a lot of different things (mobility, AR/VR, etc.) so don't hesitate to try anyway. Accelerated
                                            startups operate in a wide range of sectors which provides us with a wealth of industrial insights.

                                            We’ve seen too many well-meaning entrepreneurs with great potential either completely stuck with their project because no one could execute on decisions or burned out from carrying too much responsibility on
                                            their own.

                                            If you’re solo, take this as your first challenge: convince someone that you’re an excellent business partner and that your project has great potential. If you can’t do that, how will you persuade your customers? If you’re not ready yet, consider taking
                                            some time to strengthen your founding team and apply for the following season. NUMA won’t disappear and there will be another chance.
